### Advanced practical: Using statistical shape analysis to generate an average object and quantify uncertainties between annotations  ### 

+ this folder includes the code for the advanced practical 
+ for more information about the practical, please read the report.pdf (german)
+ all used sources can be found in the report

### Prerequisites ###

+ Python 3.8
+ Jupyter Notebook 

### Content ###

+ The file Bike.ipynb includes the whole process that started with the installation of the required Python libraries and ended with the visualization of the results. This file generates an average object and quantifies uncertainties between input data.
+ The file Bike_parameter_testing.ipynb can be used to test and evaluate different parameters.
+ In the report is a detailed explanation and introduction about this code.
